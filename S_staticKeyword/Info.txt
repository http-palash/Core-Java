static keyword:
If we want to access class members without creating an instance of the class, we need
to declare the class members static

Static variables can be accessed by calling the class name of the class.

There is no need to create an instance of the class for accessing the static
variables because static variables are the class variables and are shared among all the
class instances.


Static variables :

1. Only a single copy of the static variables is created and shared among all the
    instance of the class

2.Because it is a class level variable memory allocation of such variables only
    happens once when the class is loaded in the memory(compile time)
    (fist memory allocation to static things then other)

3.If an object modifies the value of the static variable the change is reflected
    across all objects

4.Static variables can be used in any type of method : static or non static

5.Non-static variables cannot be used inside static methods. It will throw a compile
    time error.


Static methods :

1.The static members and methods belong to the class rather than the instance of the class
    When the implementation of the particular method is not dependent on the instance
    variables and instance methods. In this case, we can make the method to be static.

2.They are accessed by the name of the class.

3.The keywords such as this and super are not used in the body of the static method

4.The modification of the static field value is not allowed/ discouraged use public static final in this case

    eg: value of Math.pi (public static final)
