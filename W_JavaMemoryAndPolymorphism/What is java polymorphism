Polymorphism allows us to perform single action in different ways.
In other words, polymorphism allows us to define one interface and have multiple
implementations.
The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms, So it means many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism.

Compile time  : method overloading ()
Runtime : method Over-ridding (child class over-ridding methods)
