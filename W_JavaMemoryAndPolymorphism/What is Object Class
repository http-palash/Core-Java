Java Object Class

Object class is present in java.lang package.
Every class in java is directly derived from the object class.
If a class does not extend any other class then it is direct child of the object and if
extends another class then it is indirectly derived.
Therefore the object class methods are available in all java classes.
Hence Object class acts as a root of the inheritance in any java program

Object Class:
    getClass()
    hashCode()
    wait()
    toString()
    clone()
    equals()
    finalize()
    notify()
    notifyall()
