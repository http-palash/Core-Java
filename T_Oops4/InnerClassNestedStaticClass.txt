A non-static nested class is class within another class. It has access to members of
the enclosing class (outer class). It is commonly known as inner class.

Since the inner class exists within the outer class, we must instantiate the outer class
first in order to instantiate inner class.

Unlike inner class, a static nested class cannot access the member variables of the
outer class. It is because the static nested class doesn't require us to create an
instance of the outer class.

Using the nested class makes our code more readable and provide better encapsulation
