Java Abstract class - to enforce methods

The abstract class in java cannot be instantiated (we cannot create objects of abstract classes)
We use abstract keyword to declare an abstract class

1.An abstract class can have both the regular methods and abstract methods.
2.A method that doesn't have its body is known as abstract method.
3.Though abstract classes cannot be instantiated, we can create subclasses from it.
    We can then access members of an abstract class using the object of subclass.
4.If the abstract class includes any abstract method, then all the child classes
    inherited from the abstract superclass must provide the implementation of the abstract class.


Java Abstraction:

Abstraction is an important concept of object-oriented programming that allows
us to hide unnecessary details and only show the needed information.

This allows us to manage complexity by omitting or hiding details with a simpler
higher level idea.
