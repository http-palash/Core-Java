Functional Interface (Introduced in java 8)

An interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface

Functional interfaces introduced in Java 8 allow us to use a lambda expression to
initiate the interfaces method and avoid using lengthy codes for the anonymous class
implementation

// interface
@V_FunctionalInterface
interface Sample{
    //abstract method
    int calculate(int val);
}
